            <h5>ron Man, also known as Tony Stark
                , is an outgoing genius billionaire,
                playboy, and philanthropist.
                He developed the powerful Iron Man Armor after being kidnapped by the Ten Rings and force
                d to build a devastating weapon. The armor has been con
                stantly evolving ever sin
                ce and is now one of the most powerfu
                l weapons technology on the planet. Tony was a mentor
                figure to Spider-Man, recruited him during the events of Captain Amer
                ica: Civil War, and even planned to bring him into the
                Avengers. Despite his confidence and bravado, Tony often feels lonely.1 Robert Downey Jr. portrayed the
                character in several Marvel Cinematic Universe films until his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame.
                Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by
                writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and
                Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title
                with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero
                team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with
                the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

                Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs
                the weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. When Stark is captured in a war zone and sustains a serious
                heart wound, he builds his iconic Iron Man armor out of scrap and escapes his captors. Iron Man's suits
                of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character
                was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories
                explored other themes, such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism,
                and governmental authority.

                Major Iron Man stories include Demon in a Bottle (1979), Armor Wars (1987–1988), Extremis (2005), and
                Iron Man 2020 (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories Civil War (2006–2007),
                Dark Reign (2008–2009), and Civil War II (2016). Iron Man's supporting cast has produced additional
                superhero characters, including James Rhodes as War Machine, Pepper Potts as Rescue, and Riri Williams
                as Ironheart as well as reformed villains Black Widow and Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes
                his archenemy, the Mandarin, as well as many supervillains of communist origin and many that double as
                business rivals for Tony.

                Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008), the first film of the Marvel Cinematic
                Universe, and continued to portray the character until his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019).
                Downey's portrayal popularized the character, elevating Iron Man as one of Marvel's most recognizable
                superheroes.

                Publication history
                Further information: List of Iron Man titles
                Creation and premiere
                Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books,
                Marvel set about creating new superhero characters. During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial
                concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in designing an unlikeable character and making him
                likeable.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United
                States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an
                active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was
                created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a
                simple matter of good versus evil".[4]

                As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with
                superheroes. The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories
                alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.[5][6]
                Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December
                1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964, the science-fiction and horror stories were removed
                entirely, with the series running only Iron Man and Captain America stories.[6]

                Larry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don
                Heck were responsible for the initial design.[1][7] Lee and Lieber used Howard Hughes as their reference
                when developing the character.[8][2] Kirby and Heck then incorporated elements of Errol Flynn's physical
                appearance in the design.[9] Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a "round and clunky gray heap",
                and the design was modified by Heck to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups. Heck
                continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel
                properties.[5][10] Heck later said that when designing Tony Stark, he was attempting to create "an Errol
                Flynn type".[11] Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, it was quickly changed to
                gold due to issues with printing.[7] Lee briefly delegated the writing to other creators at Marvel, but
                he felt that their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee again took control of Iron
                Man so he could write the stories himself.[12]
